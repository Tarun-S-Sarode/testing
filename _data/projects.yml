   This Machine Learning project focuses on predicting the crdibility of the customers or subjects for
   loan repayment by analysing different factors which determine the decission on wether to approve or reject the customer request.
   
   
   The model built focuses on techniques such as:
   - Encoding - Feature Selection and Ranking - Hyper parameter tuning - Modeling (K-NN, Decision Tree, Gaussian Navie-Bayes
